Alarm Clock With Basic GUI
  The repository "Alarm-Clock-Implementation-using-Python" https://github.com/arnab132/Alarm-Clock-using-Python by arnab132 is a Python-based implementation of an alarm clock with a basic graphical user interface (GUI). This project is an excellent example for people looking to understand how alarm clocks are programmed and how user interfaces are integrated with functionality. The code likely involves setting and checking the current time against the alarm time, and triggering an event (like playing a sound) when the times match. It's a practical application of Python programming, GUI design, and event handling in software development.
